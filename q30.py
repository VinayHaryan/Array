MAXIMUM PRODUCT SUBARRAY

Given an array that contains both positive and negative integers,
find the product of the maximum product sybarray. Expected Time complexity
is O(n) and only O(1) extra space can be used

Input: arr[] = {6, -3, -10, 0, 2}
Output:   180  // The subarray is {6, -3, -10}

Input: arr[] = {-1, -3, -10, 0, 60}
Output:   60  // The subarray is {60}

Input: arr[] = {-2, -40, 0, -2, -3}
Output:   80  // The subarray is {-2, -40}


The ide is to travese over every contiguous subarrays, find 
the product of each of these subarrays and return the maximum
product from these results

EFFICIENT SOLUTION
The following solution assumes that the given input array always has 
a positive output. The solution works for all cases mentioned above. 
It doesnâ€™t work for arrays like {0, 0, -20, 0}, {0, 0, 0}.. etc. 
The solution can be easily modified to handle this case. 

It is similar to Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray problem. 
The only thing to note here is, maximum product can also be obtained by minimum (negative) 
product ending with the previous element multiplied by this element. 
For example, in array {12, 2, -3, -5, -6, -2}, when we are at element -2, 
the maximum product is multiplication of, minimum product ending with -6 and -2.
