PRINT ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF R ELEMENTS IN A 
GIVEN ARRAY OF SIZE N

Given an array of size n, generate and print all possible combinations 
of r elements in array. For example, if input array is {1, 2, 3, 4} 
and r is 2, then output should be {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4} and {3, 4}.

Following are two methods to do this.

Method 2 (Include and Exclude every element)
Like the above method, We create a temporary array data[]. 
The idea here is similar to Subset Sum Problem. 
We one by one consider every element of input array, 
and recur for two cases:

1) The element is included in current combination 
(We put the element in data[] and increment next available index in data[])
2) The element is excluded in current combination 
(We do not put the element and do not change index)

When number of elements in data[] become equal to r 
(size of a combination), we print it.

This method is mainly based on Pascalâ€™s Identity, i.e. ncr = n-1cr + n-1cr-1

Following is implementation of method 2.
