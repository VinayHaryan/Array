Find the Missing number

You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in 
the range of 1 to n. there are no duplicates in the list. one
of the integers is missing in the list. write an efficient code
to find the missing integer

Example: 

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8}
Output: 5
Explanation: The missing number from 1 to 8 is 5

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5}
Output: 4
Explanation: The missing number from 1 to 5 is 4


** method 1: The length of the array is n-1. 
So the sum of all n elements, i.e sum of numbers 
from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. 
Now find the sum of all the elements in the array and subtract 
it from the sum of first n natural numbers, it will be the value 
of the missing element.

**Algorithm: 
Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers as sumtotal= n*(n+1)/2
Create a variable sum to store the sum of array elements.
Traverse the array from start to end.
Update the value of sum as sum = sum + array[i]
Print the missing number as sumtotal â€“ sum
